						<h3 class="about-block text">Chad Yusoff</h3>
						
						<p class="about-block text">I am a Perth based Web Developer who has recently graduated from TAFE with a Diploma of Web Development. I am 
						currently studying a Bachelor of Design, majoring in Digital Experience and Interaction Design, English and Cultural Studies Specialisation, 
						part-time at Curtin University. I have previously achieved a Diploma of Software Development and a Certificate IV in Programming.</p>
						
						<p class="about-block text">Through the course of my studies, I have come to develop a passion for minimal design and reducing complexity. 
						I focus on creating lightweight code that validates to current Web Standards. I bring both programming and design sensibilities to all 
						my projects.</p>
						
						<p class="about-block text">I am currently looking for flexible work within the Web Development industry. I also freelance in my spare-time 
						on small-scale Web Development projects and offer flexible pricing to students.</p>
						
						<p class="about-block text">I can create you the following websites:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="about-block text">Online Portfolios</li>
							<li class="about-block text">Online Resumes</li>
							<li class="about-block text">Blogs</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="work-block text works-link"><a href="https://eyesoremedia.com.au/">Eyesore Media</a></h3>
						
						<p class="work-block text">Eyesore Media is a film and television focused review blog. This blog is a passion project for my client as they 
						have a love for provocative stories (hence the name). The client plans to mainly cover Horror, Drama and Thriller titles.</p>
						
						<p class="work-block text">The client wanted a design to reflect the mood of these genres of film, be clean, and minimal. They wanted the blog to have 
						two main elements the content (review/opinion pieces) and screenshots from the titles.</p>
						
						<p class="work-block text">For the design I was inspired by movie posters and how they incorporated the title picturesquely. With the client wanting 
						screenshots to be a major visual element, I decide on styling the post links as mini movie posters. With Screen Media being a visual medium, I added motion 
						to the website mainly as user interaction notification.</p>
						
						<p class="work-block text">This website represents a culmination of all I have learnt in Front-end and Design, from my past two years learning 
						Web Development at TAFE. My goal with this website was to make it as light and independent as possible. Outside of Foundation for the layout, 
						I crafted my own modular JavaScript and CSS with pre-processed SCSS.</p>
						
						<h3 class="work-block text works-link"><a href="https://boomradio.com.au/">Boom Radio</a></h3>
						
						<p class="work-block text">As a part of my Diploma of Website Development I was put in a team with three other students. My team was tasked with 
						planning, designing, and creating a website for a real-life client. The client project my team was task with was Boom Radio, a radio station run by the 
						students of Leederville TAFE.</p>
						
						<p class="work-block text">The Boom Radio website is a post driven platform, that allows the various students to be able to create posts and 
						additional pages.  The website also includes a radio player featured on every page that lets users listen to the student’s radio shows while 
						they browse the site. The client wanted the design to be themed around comic books.</p>
						
						<p class="work-block text">My team used WordPress to implement the CMS and customised the backend to allow for proper categorising of posts. Our 
						client’s previous website had an issue with their radio player, where it would stop playing when navigating to different pages.</p>
						
						<p class="work-block text">This was a big usability issue for users and something my team wanted to rectify in this new website. To accomplish this my 
						team had to restructure the website into a single-page application. This allowed the radio player to continue to play when navigating to 
						different pages.</p>
						
						<p class="work-block text">The Boom Radio project was yearlong endeavour between designing, coding, and project management. My group faced challenges 
						ranging from technical issues, team members dropping out, gaining a new member, and working from home. We as a team overcame these issues through 
						individual hard work, teamwork, and good communication skills.</p>
						
						<h3 class="work-block text works-link"><a href="https://www.breathoflight.info/">Breath of Light</a></h3>
						
						<p class="work-block text">Breath of Light is a spiritual new age e-commerce website, that I worked on in a consultant capacity. I adjusted the 
						layout and design to be inline with modern design. I assisted the client with development issues they were encountering and provided
						advice.</p>
